# Marciana 841 (Graecus Z. 458 = Allen U4) #

Marciana 841 is a 12th or 13th century CE manuscript of the *Iliad*. The original text was two volumes, the first of which is now lost to us. The remaining half, which picks up in the middle of Book 14 and continues through the rest of the *Iliad* remains to us in the Marciana 841. While it contains fewer scholia than some of the other manuscripts, the Venetus A for instance, it does contain a Byzantine Greek translation of the *Iliad* written in prose alongside the poem. It is a lesser known manuscript and has since received comparatively less scholarship.
