# Escorial Y I.1 (294 = Allen E3) #

Escorial Y I.1 (=Allen's E3, West E) is an 11th century parchment codex consisting of 336 folios, containing a complete text of the *Iliad* with accompanying scholia. The scholia of this manuscript are closely related to those of the Venetus B; Maniaci (2006) has argued that the Venetus B and Y I.1 are “twins.” The Y I.1 also uses a numerical system to associate its commentaries with specific lines of text. The manuscript contains a second, apparently later hand, found primarily in the interlinear and intermarginal spaces. This manuscript is particularly interesting for study where it differs from its supposed “twin” as well as the other manuscripts.
