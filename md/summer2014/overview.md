# Overview #

The seminar will introduce you to the work of the [Homer Multitext project](http://www.homermultitext.org).  Our focus this year will
be on *Iliad* 12 in the oldest complete manuscript of the *Iliad*, the Venetus A.  Participants will work in teams of 2-3 student and faculty members to contribute to the first complete edition of the Venetus A ever.  Our general pattern of work will begin each morning and afternoon with a group seminar session, followed by a break-out at midmorning and midafternoon to work in teams on the following projects. 


## Projects ##

All participants will contribute to two collective projects (introduced in more detail in Washington):

-  the HMT project's "total edition" of *Iliad* 12 in the Venetus A manuscript, a scholarly diplomatic edition of the *Iliad* text, the accompanying scholia (or scholarly notes) on the text, and all other features we find in the manuscript.  *Iliad* 12 covers folios 154 verso through 163 verso in the Venetus A. Teams will be assigned a single page at a time.  Because the quantity of scholia on each page varies greatly, it is possible that some teams will complete multiple lightly annotated pages in the same time another teams spends on a single page with dense commentary.  With a little good fortune, we should come close to editing all of *Iliad* 12 while we are together in Washington, and hope to have a completed edition of *Iliad* 12 added to the HMT project's central archive before the end of the summer.
- a jointly authored essay, "On the Composition of Some Greek Manuscripts.  The Venetian Homer in 2014."  We will update a classic article on the Venetus A manuscript with digital citations of evidence.

In addition, individual groups will also work on a presentation to the rest of the seminar on one interesting research result from their editorial work.

## Greek skills covered in summer 2014 workshop ##

The seminar will introduce participants to the oral origins of Homeric poetry, and to the historical transmission of the Homeric poems.  We will see how that historical transmission leads to a multitextual perspective on the *Iliad*, and to the conclusion that in 2014 only a digital multitext can fully express a multitextual archive.

Students with any level of prior background in Greek are welcome.  All participants will be introduced to the distinctive language and style of the scholarly Greek we find in the *scholia*. 


## Technical skills covered in summer 2014 workshop ##

No specific technical background is assumed.  In the course of the seminar, all participants will become familiar with the following specific technical skills:

- using version control (`git`) to manage collaborative work
- using virtual machine software (Virutal Box, provisioned by Vagrant) to work in a standard computing environment
- using the `bash` shell to work in a POSIX system (Linux, Unix)
- citing scholarly resources with URN notation (CTS URNs, and CITE Object URNs)
- using markdown together with URN notation to format your own writing
- creating interactive slide decks, pdfs and web sites from markdown source
- editing texts in TEI-conformant XML
- brief introduction to statistical approaches to document classification and topic modelling (with R)


Additional technical topics may be offered in optional sessions, depending on the  background and interests of participants.
