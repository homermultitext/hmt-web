## Accounts ##

You will need an account on github, the service we use to host our version control work:  <https://github.com/>

Please email your github username as soon as you have an account. 


## Preparing your personal computer ##

In our 2014 seminar, all participants will work in identically configured virtual machines, which we will set up at our first meeting on Friday.  Participants should bring a laptop;  you should probably plan on having at least 5 Gb free on your disk for the virtual machine.

Please install the following free software that we will use to run our virtual machines:

- vagrant: <http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>
- virtualbox:  <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>

In addition, you should install a copy of the XML editor we will use, oXygen XML Editor:  <http://www.oxygenxml.com/download.html>

oXygen normally costs $99 for an academic license;  alternatively, you can download a complete trial version that expires after 30 days.



## Greek preparation ##

Treat yourself to one or more rereadings of the *Iliad*, and especially *Iliad* 12, the focus of our work this summer.  Feel free to read your favorite translation in English, Dutch, or other language, or as much as you like in Greek.
