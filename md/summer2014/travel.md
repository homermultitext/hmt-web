# Travel and housing arrangments #

Participants will be housed on the CHS campus.  All rooms have kitchens, and will initially be furnished with some simple breakfast food. On Monday through Friday, lunch will be provided in the dining room in the main building.  Participants are free to make their own arrangements for other meals.

## Booking ##

Participants should make their own travel arrangements, and bring all receipts with them to the seminar.   We expect that reimbursement checks and a modest fellowship for other expenses will be ready before the end of the seminar.

## Travel to CHS ##

The Center is located at 3100 Whitehaven Street, NW, Washington, DC.  There are two, unconnected sections of Whitehaven Street in Washington, so when taking a cab it is best to clarify "Whitehave Street off of Massachusetts Avenue."   The most convenient Metro stop to the Center is Dupont Circle, a little over a mile from the Center.

### By train
On the Atlantic coast, Amtrak has frequent trains to Union Station, Washington.  The red line goes directly to Dupont Circle.  The cost of a cab will vary depending on traffic and time of day, and might typically range from $12-$20.


### By plane ###


The easiest airport is Washington National (DCA).   By metro, take the blue line to Metro Center, and change there to the red line to Dupont Circle.  A cab should cost roughly $20.

From Baltimore-Washington airport (BWI), frequent trains (both Amtrak and MARC commuter trains) run to Union Station: <http://www.bwiairport.com/en/travel/ground-transportation/trans/marc>

Dulles airport (IAD) has international flights, but is actually located about 25 miles away in northern Virginia.  Information on ground transportation from Dulles: <http://www.metwashairports.com/dulles/5933.htm>. Metro service is not expected before 2018.


### By car ###

Parking is available at the Center for participants coming by car.  If you're new to driving in Washington, don't count on your GPS knowing about lane changes and road closings during commuting hours.
